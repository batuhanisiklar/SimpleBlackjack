# \## 📌 Overview

# 

# \*\*Simple Blackjack\*\* is a terminal-based implementation of the classic Blackjack card game. 

# Play against the computer dealer, draw cards, and see if you can beat the house!

# 

# ---

# 

# \## 🎮 How to Play

# 

# \- Start the game and get two cards.

# \- Type `'y'` to draw another card or `'n'` to pass.

# \- The dealer will draw cards until it reaches a score of at least 17.

# \- If your score goes over 21, you lose.

# \- Blackjack rules apply — try to get as close to 21 as possible without going over!
